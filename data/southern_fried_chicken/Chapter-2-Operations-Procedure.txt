Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
Standard Operating Procedures are intended to ensure that all of the various work tasks that are required
in a Southern Fried Chicken store are achieved at the right time, by the right people and in the right way. By
standardising a procedure you can ensure that the task is carried out consistently day by day, which in turn
will contribute greatly to your standards of operation being both safe and efficient.
All Southern Fried Chicken employees should be aware of these procedures. To enable this, the enclosed set
of encapsulated copies should be kept within easy access and the checklists completed by the supervising
employee before, during and after each trading period.
This manual contains copies of checklists for opening, trading and closing procedures. These are not necessarily
intended as control documents, but should be used as reminders. Use the encapsulated master copies for
photocopying for daily use.
Trading Procedures incorporate all of the various operating procedures applicable to equipment handling,
food production and cash handling detailed in within Standard Operating Procedures. The supervisor should
complete the checklists at least twice daily.
Opening Procedures should be carried out daily in the morning prior to opening up the store.
Closing Procedures should be carried out daily in the evening following the close of business.

No part of this manual may be given to a customer, unless they have officially signed the Southern Fried Chicken Agreement. This format is a standard format that all
potential operators must follow. Any alterations or requested alterations, must be approved by FFS BRANDS Limited or their Authorised Distributor.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

TRADING PROCEDURES
Trading procedures cover all aspects of the Southern Fried Chicken system. The major issues are covered in
their individual bulletins; however a number of general work practices are set out in the following pages.
These are invariably concerned with maintaining cleanliness at all times, courtesy on the part of all Southern
Fried Chicken store employees and quality of all Southern Fried Chicken products.
Use of the Southern Fried Chicken observation checklist will help to ensure that our standards of trading are
maintained.

Courtesy
All employees should be actively encouraged to display utmost courtesy to customers at all times. Examples
of Southern Fried Chicken courtesy are the greeting of all customers as they enter the store or approach the
foodservice counter; assisting elderly people, mothers with young children or heavy shopping, people with
disabilities, and anybody else who may require a helping hand.
In all circumstances, customers should be greeted in a friendly way and with a smile. Remember that we only
ever have one chance to make a good impression.

Greeting Customers
Greetings such as "Good morning/evening, how may I help you?" should be encouraged on the part of all
counter assistants. In any event it is essential that all customers are acknowledged as they approach the
counter, even if this means informing them of a short delay in service: "I'll be with you in just a moment" is
far preferable to the customer than no acknowledgement at all.
In greeting customers, or in inviting customers in a queue to move to a register, which has no queue, employees
should never shout or be abrupt.

Taking Orders
Most customers will have an opportunity to study the Southern Fried Chicken menu whilst waiting in line and
will know what they want to order on arriving at the register. On no account should a counter assistant display
any impatience with any customer who takes time in making up their mind.
All orders should be registered in the cash register and it is advisable that the order is read back to the
customer as it is displayed on the screen prior to making the order up. The cashier should ask if the meals are
for eat-in or carryout.
Following registration, the total money due should be communicated to the customer, for example “That’ll
be £4.25, please”. If a large denomination note is presented it is always wise to confirm acceptance by saying
“Out of £10” or whatever note has been offered. This acts as a check to ensure that the cashier does not find
him/herself in a situation of giving, or being accused of giving, incorrect change. It is also a deterrent to a
frequent style of fraud.

No part of this manual may be given to a customer, unless they have officially signed the Southern Fried Chicken Agreement. This format is a standard format that all
potential operators must follow. Any alterations or requested alterations, must be approved by FFS BRANDS Limited or their Authorised Distributor.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

Order Make-Up
The cashier taking the order makes up orders. Most menu items are available for immediate pick-up and can
be made up without delay. Items, which may not be immediately available, such as pizza, should be ordered
from the kitchen and the customer informed that there will be a short wait. Suggest to the customer that he
takes a seat, and offer to bring the completed meals over to him when they are ready.
Where a wait-time exists, delay the make-up of other menu items until the prepared item is ready; this way
the group can eat together.
Make up beverages first, then cold food then hot food. Place all items on a tray (for eat-in orders) or in carrier
bags for take-out orders.

Special Orders
Special orders should always be accepted. Examples of special orders are hamburgers with no lettuce, or
‘plain grilled’. In these circumstances the customer should be informed that there will be a short delay whilst
the special order is made up. Again it is preferable to invite the customer to take a seat whilst the meal is
being prepared, and to take the food over to him when ready.

Speed of Service
Speed is a major factor in a customer deciding to visit a Southern Fried Chicken store. It is essential, therefore,
that all staff display a sense of urgency in their work and respond quickly to customer requests. Under no
account should this lead to any rushing or other unsafe work practice.
Speed is best achieved by correct and appropriate preparation. The front and rear service counters will have
been designed to store sufficient quantities of disposable packaging, condiments and other ancillaries for
each menu item. These should be topped up throughout the day to ensure that staff do not have to leave
the counter area during order make-up, or worse still, to ensure that the counter do not run out of anything
which will clearly affect the speed of service of meals.

Service Procedures
Foods should be assembled and packaged according to the standard presentation procedures detailed
separately. Refer to photograph illustrations for correct service presentation.
Upon complete delivery of a customer's order, the counter assistant should always acknowledge the customer
by saying "Thank you, enjoy your meal" or similar courtesy. When the store is busy there may be queues at
the cash register. In such situations counter staff should be encouraged to call waiting customers over to their
register if their position is less busy than others are.

Counter Cleanliness
The counter and its shelves should be kept clean and tidy at all times. This means that during service times
staff should be responsible for wiping the counter surface, tidying shelves, replenishing condiment, napkin
and drinking straw stocks, and keeping the floor clean. Equally, staff uniforms should be maintained in a clean
and neat condition throughout the service operation.

No part of this manual may be given to a customer, unless they have officially signed the Southern Fried Chicken Agreement. This format is a standard format that all
potential operators must follow. Any alterations or requested alterations, must be approved by FFS BRANDS Limited or their Authorised Distributor.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

Restaurant Area
On a regular basis at least one member of staff should be assigned to the restaurant area. Their principle
tasks are to clear and clean tables, empty waste-bins, re-arrange any mobile furniture, polish glass, brass and
woodwork, and sweep and mop the floor.
Table debris should be cleared using foodservice trays and emptied into the waste-bins. The table should then
be wiped down with a solution of cleansing agent, a clean ashtray replaced and the furniture arranged for the
next customers.
Seats should be similarly cleaned after each use.
The floor should be kept spotlessly clean at all times. When mopping is in progress, a yellow warning sign
should be used to warn customers that there is a potential danger of slipping if the floor is still wet. Clean
mops should be used and the water in the mop bucket changed after each cleaning task. Mop buckets and
brushes should never be left in the restaurant area, nor in the food production area.
Bins should be emptied regularly. They should not be allowed to fill beyond three-quarters of their capacity,
and upon removal should be securely tied to avoid spillage. Rubbish should be removed to the rear service/
collection. Upon each emptying, the waste bin should be cleaned down and a new liner inserted.
Polished features such as brass or chrome in the restaurant area should be kept clean at all times by polishing
with a soft cloth, and similarly windows and glass in doors should be cleaned as often as necessary.
The employee designated to supervise the restaurant area should also ensure that fire exits are clear of
obstruction at all times. In the event that a customer’s belongings, for example a pushchair block an exit, the
customer should be requested politely that the article be moved to an alternative place. It is always better to
suggest an alternative location rather than let the customer find one.

Outdoor Litter Patrols
Check too, that the outside of the store is clean and free of litter. This applies particularly during busy periods
such as lunchtimes and evenings. For each shift, an Outdoor Litter Patrol comprising one member of staff
should be assigned to periodically check and sweep the front of the store, empty any litter bins which may
be in the immediate vicinity and to ensure that our general standards of cleanliness are apparent outside as
well as in.
All the above procedures should be carried out with minimal, and if possible, no disruption to customers
using the restaurant. Discretion and observation are the keys to achieving this.

Toilet Facilities
A great number of restaurant users will say that their overall impression of a restaurant is determined by the
state of the toilet facilities. Southern Fried Chicken stores therefore have rigorous operating procedures to
ensure that toilet facilities are kept clean and adequately stocked at all times.
A check-sheet should be posted in each toilet for completion every 30 minutes throughout the day.
Responsibility for checking normally rests with the supervisor on duty, and should include:
•
total cleanliness of floors, walls and fixtures
•
adequacy of stocks of soaps, towels and paper rolls.
In the event that a shortfall occurs in either of these areas, an employee should be asked to correct the matter
without delay.
The check-sheet should be completed using a Chinagraph pencil or similar instrument.

No part of this manual may be given to a customer, unless they have officially signed the Southern Fried Chicken Agreement. This format is a standard format that all
potential operators must follow. Any alterations or requested alterations, must be approved by FFS BRANDS Limited or their Authorised Distributor.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

Customer Complaints
Complaints, which are brought to the attention of the management, should be handled with total courtesy
and discretion. All complaints should be referred to a member of management in any event. The vast majority
of complaints can be rectified on the spot and without major difficulties; however it should be borne in mind
that most people are embarrassed to complain. Instead they ‘vote with their feet' and do not visit the store
again.
Following these general rules will ensure that the customer will leave the store totally satisfied:
• ALWAYS listen to the complaint
• NEVER argue - nobody ever won an argument with a customer
• TRY to determine the reason for the complaint arising in the first place
• REPLACE food without question, if the complaint is about quality
• APOLOGISE in any event, but do not make excuses
• TREAT the complaint seriously.
Written complaints are infrequent. In such circumstances it is advisable to telephone the customer in order
to put matters right, or better still go to their home and see them.

Customer Service
Customer service is a vital part of any business and for that matter there are very few businesses who do not
make mention somewhere in their philosophy of customer service, customer care or other service description.
What really counts are those businesses, which uphold their service values and "practice what they preach".
At Southern Fried Chicken, we are not unrealistic enough to recognise that the customer is not always right.
What we do recognise, however, is that the customer is always the customer and without him we cannot
survive. To illustrate our values of good customer service, we have set out below some of the ways in which
we could lose a customer: in other words, how customer service should not be practiced!

How to Lose a Customer
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Let the customer wait, they have plenty of time.
Wait until they speak to you.
Let them thank you now and again.
Never give the customer anything extra - especially extra service.
Don't get friendly with customers.
If you have to say "No", say it quick.
If you are right about something, make sure they know it.
If you don't know them, serve regulars first.
Ignore complaints - especially if you know they're not going to come back anyway.
Tell them all your personal problems.
If you're busy, tell the customer so

Standards of Presentation
Presentation is another vitally important factor in the success of Southern Fried Chicken. Besides cleanliness
and appearance of both the store itself and its employees, a number of other points should be noticed and
checked regularly.

No part of this manual may be given to a customer, unless they have officially signed the Southern Fried Chicken Agreement. This format is a standard format that all
potential operators must follow. Any alterations or requested alterations, must be approved by FFS BRANDS Limited or their Authorised Distributor.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

Maintenance and Upkeep
The standard of maintenance in a store is the root of good presentation. As a result, frequent maintenance
checks should be carried out in all areas. In some cases these checks can relate to health and safety aspects
too. The following areas should be regularly surveyed. A Maintenance Check-List is provided for use in this
area:
• Floor surfaces - chipped, broken or damaged?
• Wall tiles - chipped, loose, damaged or missing?
• Woodwork - damaged, splintered, loose or stained?
• Metalwork - tarnished, loose, dented or rough?
• Glass - broken, cracked, missing?
• Fixtures - chipped, damaged, un-painted or worn?
• Electrics - unsecured, bare wires, sockets damaged, unprotected?
• Light bulbs - not working, flickering?
• Plumbing - leaks, drips, loose or damaged?
• Equipment - not functioning correctly?
• Signs - not illuminating?
• Cables - trailing, extension leads being used?
• Door closer - not working, jammed?
If any of the above items warrant a Yes answer, then replacement or proper repair is required without
delay.

potential operators must follow. Any alterations or requested alterations, must be approved by FFS BRANDS Limited or their Authorised Distributor.

Front & Rear Counter Layout
The Front and Rear service counter are key items as they affect:
• speed of service
• image of the store
The customer service area leader is responsible for ensuring that the front service area is set up correctly and
that it is:
• Clean
• In good repair, cup dispenser gaskets are in good condition.
• All items are correctly stored as per the standards below.
• That there is sufficient stock to last through the session, until there
is an opportunity to re-stock. If there is insufficient stock and stock
runs out during service customers will have to wait whilst new stock
is taken from the stock room.
• Use a stock list to help ensure that nothing is missed or forgotten.
Different stores will have different quantities, use the sheet attached.

The Front Service Counter Layout
The front counter is laid out in a repeating pattern so that all the counter
staff have quick access to the essentials within 1 meter either side of
their till. This reduces unnecessary movement around the service area
and increases their efficiency

Staff must have access to cleaning chemicals. They will need either a trigger spray and paper towel or a 1/6GN pan with sanitising solution and a cloth.

The precise stock will vary with: product mix, sales volumes. Eating or take away sales

Additional bulk stocks can be held at the back of the counter so staff can easily restock items at the front of the counter

The above picture illustrates the general layout of the counter, with all the items that staff need quick access to within easy reach.

Service Skills
Offering quick and friendly service is one of the 3 keystones of success of Southern Fried Chicken.
The service needs to be just as friendly to the 100th customer as it was to the first, so we need to understand:

What is Friendly service?
Friendly service is more than just using the right words; we need to communicate positively and confidently
with the customer to make them feel welcome and we do this by using body language
Body language is a constant non-verbal flow of communication. Without speaking and often without realising
we communicate what we are feeling and thinking.
We can all read body language sometimes subconsciously and it can deeply affect our impression of other
people.
Think about these examples:
• the cashier who is leaning on the counter
• the interviewee who folds their arms
• the sales assistant who never looks at you
Studies show that we communicate in far more subtle ways than just by understanding the words that people
use.
A huge 55% of the message we send to our customer is body language, the other 38% comes from the tone
of our voice and a tiny 7% comes from the words we use.

Eye to eye contact
The eyes are said to be the window of the soul and making eye contact with your customer is one of the
simplest yet most effective gestures. But take care, eye contact is not a staring match; look away from time
to time.

Smile
Make your customer feel welcome by smiling at them. Remember it takes more muscles to frown than smile,
so save energy and smile.

Posture
The way you stand shows if you are interested and attentive to your customer or bored. Lean forward slightly,
face your customer and nod occasionally. Nodding lets your customer know that you are still listening but
does not interrupt them.

Can I help you?
A simple phrase like “Can I help you?” should have just one meaning but can have many meanings depending
upon how it is said.
When speaking with customers we need to be aware of:
• the pitch of our voice
• the inflection of our voice and where we place the emphasis on the words we use
• pace or the speed at which we speak
Think about the different ways “Can I help you?” can be said and how changing the pace or inflection can
subtly change the meaning from anxious to help to aggressive or dismissive.

Service
Effective service is fast, friendly & efficient, it delivers hot fresh food. Smiling, making eye contact and speaking
with the customer correctly is very important but by following a simple 8 step method each customer will be
guaranteed to receive friendly & effective service that help to drive up sales.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

Customer Complaint Handling
Customer complaints are a goldmine of information.
Complaints offer our restaurants an opportunity to correct immediate problems. In addition, they frequently
provide constructive ideas for improving products, adapting marketing practices, upgrading services or
modifying promotional material and product information.
While some complaints are always going to happen, cold food etc. it is not always inevitable that this should
lead to unhappy customers, restaurants can learn to recover from mistakes. A good recovery can turn angry,
frustrated customers into loyal ones.
By talking back when they believe they have not received their money's worth, consumers give businesses
an opportunity to correct the immediate problem and restore goodwill. Experience shows that consumers
who complain about products and services continue to frequent the businesses and buy the products they
complain about if they believe the complaint was resolved fairly.
Research into complaints behaviour reveals that only a fraction of dissatisfied consumers complain to business
and thereby, gives the company an opportunity to correct the problem. There is evidence that some consumers
do not complain because they are sceptical about business's willingness or ability to resolve disputes fairly.
Consumers simply withdraw their patronage and criticise the company or the product to others.
Such findings underscore the importance to business of a complaint management system that is wellpublicised and easily accessible. An unregistered complaint may do as much harm as one that is mismanaged
or not resolved.
Careful complaint management can save business unwanted costs. For example, negative word-of-mouth
publicity or negative comments on social media such as twitter or Facebook, from dis-satisfied consumers
means lost revenue and necessitates additional investment in advertising to attract replacement customers.
Empowering front line staff to resolve customer complaints will aid in delivering customer satisfaction, but to
do this successfully they will need to be equipped with the necessary skills and authority.

Responding, where appropriate to complains on social media
can be very beneficial as this shows a caring public face and the
willingness to be open when resolving complaints.

• Staff should be able to replace incorrect product, cold fries,

incorrect burgers etc. with little or no reference to a manager
other than to correctly record the complimentary food on a
sheet or the till.
• Staff must be aware of how to handle customer complaints
and the risks if they are not handled correctly.
Customer complaints about poor quality, incorrect or cold product
can thus be easily resolved, restoring the customer’s faith in the
brand and reducing the negative word of mouth publicity.
Most customer complaints can be successfully resolved using the
L.A.S.T. method.

potential operators must follow. Any alterations or requested alterations, must be approved by FFS BRANDS Limited or their Authorised Distributor.

Listen
Listen to what the customer has to say. Use active listen skills, such as asking open ended questions to clarify
any point, nodding when appropriate to show that you are listening and sympathetic. Allow them to express
their frustration, don’t’ take anything personally; the customer is annoyed at the situation not at the individual.
Para phrase back to the customer what they have told you to make sure you have correctly understood.

Apologise
Apologise for the specific thing that has gone wrong, don’t make excuses. Our problems are not the customer’s
problems. Be sincere.

Solution
Agree a solution with the customer. If possible, lead the customer to find an agreeable solution as this will
help ensure that it will resolve the problem.
Make sure that you deliver the solution, as to fail at this point will make the complaint much harder to resolve
later.
It is better to “under promise and over deliver” than to disappoint the customer again.

Thank
Thank the customer for letting you know about their disappointment.
Remember, customer complaints are a goldmine of information about our business, they let us know what
is going wrong and give us an opportunity to put it right, to keep that customer and all the other customers
who would not have complained, but suffered in silence and then told all their colleges, friend, family about
their disappointment at the hands of SFC. So thank the customer for complaining!
Of course staff will not be able to handle all customer complaints and the more serious ones must be referred
to management. Cold food, incorrect or missing product can be quickly resolved by counter staff. Complaints
such as foreign objects in food or food related illness must be immediately referred to management; if
managers are not available immediately the member of staff should take the details of the customer and
ensure that they are contacted by the store manager as soon as possible. Complaints of this nature can
escalate very quickly so the manager should make contact at the earliest possible opportunity, probably by
phone and make every effort to resolve the complaint.
In the event of a foreign body complaint the staff member or person dealing with the complaint should try to
retain the foreign body.

Visual Impressions
The use of electric extension leads temporary or hand-written signs and other ‘quick-fix' methods as well as
poor employee behaviour detract from the overall presentation of the store. The following is a list of such
items, which should be consciously avoided:
• use of electric extension leads
• use of hand-written signs
• exposure of cardboard packing cases
• sellotape on walls
• light bulbs not working
• dirt
• poor maintenance standards
• empty shelves
• visible raw food
• visible rubbish
• employees smoking
• employees leaning, chatting or sitting down
• arguments of all descriptions
The Maintenance and Observation Check-Lists should assist in ensuring that these situations are absent from
the store.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

CASH HANDLING PROCEDURES
The following procedures can be applied to the handling of all cash within the store and should form the basis
of your own cash handling policy.
Note that employees who are required to handle cash should be made aware of this policy and be fully
trained in its operation. If you wish to hold and make individual employees personally responsible for cash
handled within the business then you must have their consent in writing to this effect.

Issue of Floats
A cash float issue book should be maintained in order to record and control the issue of cash to employees
for change purposes.
Floats need not exceed £100.00 per register and should be checked in the presence of the issuing supervisor
and the employee who will sign accepting responsibility for it.

Cash Registration
ALL transactions including staff meals and food wastage should be recorded in the cash register.

Cash Pick-Ups
During the course of trading it may be that cash requires “picking up” from the cash register for security and
convenience purposes. In such circumstances, a pick-up registration should be made by the supervisor on the
cash register itself and a signed voucher replaced in the drawer.
It is strongly recommended that cash pick-ups are made when the cash register contains £1,500.00.

Cash Reconciliation
At the close of each shift and at the close of business cash reconciliation should be performed by each cashier
and checked by the supervisor. The purpose of this is to ensure that the cash in drawer balances the total of
cash registrations. Where cash has been picked-up, as above, the voucher left in exchange counts as cash,
and where vouchers or other coupons have been accepted instead of cash, their total should also balance the
total of voucher registrations in the till.
A suggested standard variance tolerance for cash balances is 50p. per £200.00 either way.
In the event that the cash receipts and total of cash registrations do not balance to within the above tolerance
an investigation should be carried out including the re-counting of cash and verification of all types of receipt
where possible i.e. cash, cheques, vouchers, staff meals etc.
Incorrect cash handling can be deemed to be an offence under Employee Disciplinary Procedure.

Cash Storage and Security
If left in the premises overnight all cash should be securely locked away in a safe. Preferable, however, is an
arrangement with your local bank for night-safe facilities whereby cash can be safely deposited daily.

CHILDREN’S PARTIES
Children’s Parties are very good for building brand loyalty in our youngest customers, however when badly
managed parties can be a major source of complaints.
First and foremost with children’s parties it is vital to have selected a good party host.
Party hosts should have the following characteristics:
1. An outgoing and engaging personality
2. Able to develop a rapport with children
3. Ability to organise children to play games
4. Awareness of Health and Safety
5. Smart appearance
6. Enthusiasm!!!
Each party should have 2 hosts, one to entertain the children, and another to organise and collect the food.

Organising the Party
The party should take place in an area dedicated to Kids parties, it should be brightly decorated and possibly
have a kids play area attached.
The store should have kids party invitations to give to party organisers. These can have blank spaces for
the organizers to fill out the guests name, birthday child’s name, time and date of the party. The restaurant
address should be pre-printed on the invitation.
Some stores provide a themed birthday cake. Party organisers should be encouraged to order them before
the day of the party.
The party host should prepare for the party, making sure that the party area is clean and festively decorated.
Suitable party packs should be available with a small gift for the birthday child. Party packs should include:
A hat
A small toy such as colouring pencils
A badge
The party host should organise the children to play some games or competitions and a small prize should be
awarded to the winner. Possible games include:
• Musical chairs
• Pass the parcel
• Pin the tale on the donkey
• Musical statues
• Simon says
The list of possible games is endless and the party host should choose games that reflect the groups ages
and interest.

Operation Procedure / Issue 1-2017

The Party host should take a food order form the children offering them a choice of meals from the kid’s
menu. The party host should not leave the group unattended so the party assistant should organise the food
order and delivery to the group.
After the children have eaten, the party host can offer the children the birthday cake.
More games and activities should follow. Most parties should last about 2 hours.
Most stores charge per child attending the party plus a cost for the food, for example a charge of £2.00
per child plus the cost of a child’s meal per guest, plus the cost of a cake if required. Parents should also be
allowed to bring their own cakes if they wish to do so.

Party organisers must ensure that there is a minimum of 1
responsible parent or guardian per 4 children attending the party.
SFC Restaurants must not offer to baby-sit children
SFC Restaurants offer only, a venue, food and entertainment and
cannot supervise the children
