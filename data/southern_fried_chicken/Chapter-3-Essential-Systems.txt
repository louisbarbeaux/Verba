Food Cost Control
In a typical SFC the cost of the food is the single largest expense for the business; a typical SFC will have a food
cost of about 30 to 35% depending upon the pricing policy. The menu should be properly costed as only then
can it be determined what GP the store should be generating
The food cost can be influenced by a number of factors including:
• Raw Product costs.
• Raw Product quality.
• Portion control
• Raw waste
• Cooked waste
• Stock loss and back door procedures
• Rough handling of stock.

Raw Product Costs
Poor purchasing can lead to higher cost ingredients being used. It is important to ensure that the best prices
are obtained for all products. This is most noticeable with high cost ingredients such as chicken fillets which
can vary substantially in price from one suppler to another.

Raw Product Quality
Poor quality raw products will lead to wastage or increased portion size. This is especially noticeable with
fries as poor quality fries tend to be shorter; this means that more fries are needed to fill a fry bag resulting
in heavier portions than costed, so any perceived saving is lost when giving out bigger portions.

Portion Control
Portion control is a management issue in store. Too small a portion will lead to dis‐satisfied customers, too
large a portion will lead to a high food cost. Even a small variance on key products can have a significant
impact on food cost. Two key examples are:

1. Chicken strips being cut incorrectly. If the target weight of a chicken strip is 35g, but staff are cutting at an

average of 45g, our food cost percentage will increase to almost 45% on this product, reducing our GP%
on this item to about 55%. Depending upon the product mix this could be a 1 or 2 % increase in food cost.

2. Incorrectly portioned fries, perhaps because the fries are damaged through poor handling or are just

poor quality is a common occurrence in fast food restaurants. Target weights can be exceeded by as much
as 20% to 30% so a 110g portion can become as much as 140g, if this is repeated time and time again it
can add significant cost, especially as almost 95% of transactions in our stores will include fries.

There are any number of other examples and managers must be vigilant to ensure that portion control is
properly maintained. Each store should be equipped with some robust and accurate commercial scale so that
managers can get staff in the habit of weighing product.

Raw Waste
Raw waste is throwing away uncooked ingredients.
It can come from 2 sources.
Acceptable waste comes from the correct preparation of the ingredients, such as the core of a tomato or
when the rerun cycle is broken on a shake machine. This must be kept to a minimum but is a normal part of
the business.
Unacceptable waste comes from:
• Poor ordering simply have more product in the restaurant than can be used within the use by date of the
product.
• Poor stock rotation such as failing to use first in first out “FIFO” and allowing food to go out of date.
• Allowing buns etc. to dry out, rendering them unusable.
• Excessive stock holding especially of fresh products like chicken or vegetable products.
• Throwing containers away that still contain usable food, i.e. not using the last few beans in a tin or the
last spoonful of coleslaw.
• Excessive wastage during the preparation of food, such as discarding product because it is badly or
wrongly cut.
All these will act to increase the food cost and most are avoidable with good management practices such as
ordering using a “Usage per £1000” system and ensuring good stock rotation using “FIFO”.

Cooked Waste
Cooked waste is discarding any menu item that has exceeded its maximum holding time such as 120 minutes
for chicken and 60 minutes for fillets and 10 minutes for sandwiches.
Conflicting pressures on staff and managers often lead them to hold food until it is well beyond the maximum
holding time, this reduces the amount of wastage they have to declare and any resulting issues or reprimands
they may face. Also, it is ingrained in to most people’s behaviour not to waste food especially when they are
trying to achieve financial targets. This results in poor quality product reaching the customer and high levels
of customer dis‐satisfaction and loss of repeat custom.
Discarded cooked product must be recorded on the appropriate form so that wastage may be accurately
tracked. Providing staff with accurate information on the level of sales they may expect will help reduce
wastage, however a degree of wastage of between 1 to 2 % must be accepted in order to maintain quality. If
the wastage exceeds a reasonable amount the root cause will need to be identified and tackled.
The main causes of excessive cooked waste are:
• Staff cooking excessive amounts to reduce the work load. Lazy staff will cook lots of product so they can
clean down and have a break. The food will then need to be discarded as it goes out of time. Staff must
be encouraged to cook little and often.
• Lack of awareness of business patterns. Staff fail to anticipate that they are reaching the end of a busy
period and do not scale back production accordingly resulting in over production.
• Over compensation, when staff run out of product they will tend to over compensate by producing too
much food, resulting in the need to discard food as it goes out of time.

Stock Loss and back door procedures
Stock loss or shrinkage is usually the result of theft of high value food items such as chicken fillets, these items
are very desirable and portable, staff can easily be tempted to take them home. Stock shrinkage can have a

very significant impact on the food cost and managers must be vigilant to ensure that it does not happen.
Whilst isolated cases of petty theft are common in this business, it is also not uncommon to find almost
wholesale theft of large quantities of product. Individuals often start out small and when they are able to get
away with it grow bolder, taking larger quantities more frequently.
Theft also takes the form of giving food to friends when they visit the restaurant, managers must be vigilant
for this. CCTV will help prove any incidences of this but managers should be on the lookout for staff members
serving their family or friends, or customers who suddenly seem to be able to afford quantities of food at
odds with their normal buying pattern. Although not shrinkage, theft of cash from the tills by employees
will reduce the reported net sales and decrease the gross profit. Be aware of excessive cash shortages or
transaction reductions which can indicate the theft of cash.
Methods to discourage shrinkage:
• The use of CCTV to monitor staff.
• Weekly inventory of high value items to identify discrepancies. In some stores it could be appropriate to
do this daily.
• Control issue of product from the store room, by having a dedicated store person.
• Key control, only approved staff can access the stores, reducing opportunity for theft.
• Staff searches.
Back door procedures must be complied with. As well as the safety checks and quality checks outlined
elsewhere in this manual it is key that the products being signed for are present. Supervisors, managers or
store man must be diligent in checking that the deliveries are correct. Unless unavoidable, such as in small
stores, general staff must not be allowed to sign for deliveries. All deliveries must be stored promptly and
correctly according to the operations manual.

Rough Handling of Stock
Most products are susceptible to rough handling and can be easily damaged. Rough handling of fries will
break the fries and make for poorer yields. Staff must be encouraged to treat all the food products gently and
not to be rough with them.

Inventory
Southern Fried Chicken stores are required to do a complete food cost calculation at the end of each month.
This requires a degree of preparation, you will need.
• An inventory or stock sheet, an example of which you will find in this document.
• Up to date prices for all the food and packaging items purchased recorded on the stock sheet
• Previous closing stock value, now this periods opening value
Transfers in or transfers out is
movement between stores of
• Invoices for any deliveries during the period.
any product. i.e. Store A lends
• Value of any transfers to or from the store
store B a tray of buns, is a transfer
Consumption, the value of food and packaging goods used is calculated by using the formula below
Opening stock + deliveries+ transfers in – transfers out‐closing stock= consumption
Consumption / net sales x 100 = food cost%
Net sales – consumption = Gross Profit
Gross profit/net sales x 100= Gross profit %
To calculate the value of the closing stock the store management will need to complete an inventory or stock
count. This means all the goods food and packaging in the restaurant must be accurately counted and their
value calculated. This is a complex task and needs to be done properly. Some tips on how to make it more
accurate and less frustrating are.
1. Reduce the amount of stock being carried immediately prior to the inventory by running the stock levels
down as far as possible.
2. Try to delay any deliveries until after stocktake
3. Ensure that the restaurant is clean and tidy; mess will make the count a lot more difficult.
4. Ensure stock is well organised, and accessible. Like products should be stacked and in the same location. If
there are a number of outers of any item open, make as many full outers as possible. It’s easier to count 3 box
than 1 box and 3 bags and 4 bags
5. Pre‐count any arrears where stock will not move i.e. check that all areas have just sufficient stock then
count and lock the stock room
When the business is closed, work slowly and
methodically recording the number of full cases and
loose units, and record them on the stock sheet.
Ideally using Excel transfer this information in to a
spread sheet and calculate the closing stock value.
Good accountancy practice is to remove the cost of
staff meals from the GP calculation as this is part of
the labour cost.

Labour Control and Staff Scheduling
Staff costs are typically the second highest cost that the restaurant incurs, so it is important for the success of
the business that scheduling of staff is done effectively.
While a busy store will operate with a labour cost of 25% to 30%, quieter stores will have higher labour costs.
The labour cost percentage is a product of effective scheduling, rather than effective scheduling being a
product of the labour cost.
Factors to take into account when scheduling staff are:
• Expected sales volumes and sales patterns
• Staff availability. Shift patterns etc.
• Staff experience and skills mix
• Training needs
• Special events
• Minimum staffing levels

Expected Sales Volumes and Sales Patterns
This information should be available from the sales history sheet discussed in the previous chapter. You will
need to know the net sales for last week and for last year and the hourly sales for an equivalent week (usually
gross sales depending upon the till systems).
On the left, you can see last week’s daily sales. On the
right, the gross hourly sales. From this information and
knowledge of target SPMH (sales per man hours) it is
possible to create a matrix of the required number of
staff.

Sales per Man Hour
This figure is calculated by dividing the gross
hourly sales by the number of labour hours
used. This will give an indication of how
effectively staff is working.
SPMH should average around £28.00 to
£50.00. Below £28.00 SPMH, labour cost will
be high; above £50.00 SPMH the staff may
not be able to deliver QSC to the required
standard. Additional staff should be scheduled
to help maximise sales opportunities.
Based on the expected sales, target SPMH
and minimum staffing levels it is possible to
create a staffing matrix, as per the example
on the next page.

Staffing matrix example for a normal week:

This staffing matrix sets the staffing standard for each hour of the week, taking account of the hourly sales,
minimum staffing standard and special requirements.

Staffing matrix example for a busy school holiday:

This shows a big increase in sales on the weekdays, when a larger number of staff will be required.
It may not be possible in all cases to staff up to the highest staff levels, such as Friday between 1pm and 2pm,
if there are not enough staff on the payroll. However, if the store is adequately prepared with skilled and
experienced staff, the problem can be overcome.

Sales History
Recording daily sales history is a routine function of store management. It is also a legal and contractual
requirement of Fast Food Systems.
Southern Fried Chicken will provide a standard Excel spread sheet located in Cloud and accessible via the
internet. This must be completed daily by store management and will be reviewed by head office staff.
The information recorded on the spreadsheet forms the basis of one of the most valuable tools in the business:
history.
This history has many uses including:
• Monitoring the business trends, seeing how any business is performing in key areas.
• Benchmarking. Comparing good and bad performance, both internally and with other franchisees.
• Identifying areas of bad performance and providing tools to help improve.
• Managing staff costs by helping to accurately identify quiet and busy periods and to staff accordingly.
• Managing food costs by assisting with accurate ordering, when done in conjunction with a usage per
£1,000.
• By providing feedback on decisions relating to sales or labour.
• Giving insight in to the “big picture” about the performance of the business and the use of resources.

How to Complete the Sheet
Section 1: Sales

POS Sales:

Sales as recorded by the point of sales

Net sales:

POS Sales less VAT. This is calculated by a formula

CARD TRAN:

Credit/debit card sales

CASH TRANS:

Cash sales

Total sales:

Sum of cash and credit card sales

Cash +/‐:

Cash loss or gain. Variance over £1 should be followed up

T/C:

Transaction count, the number of transactions

Av Spend:

The POS Sales divided by T/C to give the average value of one transaction.

Voids: Items removed from transactions due to cashier error or customers changing their mind. High
figures could indicate theft and should be investigated.

Section 2: Promotions redeemed
This section is reserved for any current promotions, the number of transactions and their value should be recorded

Section 3: Net Delivery Sales

This records the net delivery sales and transaction count for each type of delivery (e.g. phone or web) and calculates
the percentage of total sales and the average delivery spend.

Section 4: Labour costs

This section uses information input in the staff hours section (see next page) to calculate an approximate labour
cost.
Labour is usually the second biggest cost in the restaurant after food and will have the biggest impact on profit if it
is poorly managed or labour is wasted.

Staff working hours are entered in to this section and a cost is calculated using each individuals’ hourly rate plus on
costs such as employer NI and holiday costs. This sheet adds 16% to the hourly rate to reflect these costs.

Staff working hours are entered in to this section and a cost is calculated using each individuals’ hourly rate
plus on costs such as employer NI and holiday costs. This sheet adds 16% to the hourly rate to reflect these
costs.
Using the staff working hours, the sheet fills in the
number of staff working in each hour (ignoring
breaks)
The hourly sales are entered from the till reading
and the sheet, then calculates the Sales Per Man
Hour (SPMH). This gives an indication of how
effectively the staff is being scheduled.
In stores where manning levels can be above the
minimum it will show when the store is under or
over staffed. Minimum SPMH is around £17.00 to
cover staff and food costs; ideally SPMH should be
in the region of £40.00 to £50.00
Where the SPMH starts to exceed these levels
routinely additional staff should be scheduled as
the staff will not be able to maintain the standards
of Quality, Service and Cleanliness.
The detailed sales history will allow the
management to plan effectively and to identify the
busy and quiet periods and to use this information
to schedule the appropriate number of staff.

Section 5: Sales Trends

This section compares current weeks sales with the previous weeks sales and with this week last year. This
will show any sales trends.
Stores should always show an increase in sales over last year as price increase mean that even like for like
sales will be slightly better than the previous year.

The Summary Page
The summary page summarises all the sales
information over the year in a single page. It also
has various graphs so sales trends can be clearly
seen.
The graph below shows, total sales, in store sales,
transactions and average spend.

Usage Per £1000
Effective ordering will help manage the food cost as the store will have adequate stocks of food for the level
of anticipated business.
Having a usage per £1000.00 figure will make ordering a science rather than an art. For example the usage
per £100.00 for 9 cut chicken is 3.35
Calculating a usage per £1000.00 figure
To calculate the usage per £100.00 figure you will need to know:
• Opening stock figure e.g. 4 cases of chicken
• Deliveries or transfer during the period
• Closing stock figure e.g. 2 case of chicken
Calculate the consumption using the same formula mentioned previously in the chapter
Divide the consumption or usage by the sales and multiply by 1000
